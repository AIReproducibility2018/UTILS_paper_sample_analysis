date of export: 20171121

Each publication year is exported separately, resulting in one .csv export for
each year (in this case, for the years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016).

Each export is (at the time of export) given the default name "scopus.csv" by
Scopus, so to keep them separate (and to keep track of which export is from
which year), the files are manually named scopus_year.csv (e.g for 2012, this
would be scopus_2012.csv).

Additionally, the search strings used has been manually stored in the files
scopus_year.search (though take note that the search string does not perform
the sort by citation count, which has to be performed as a separate step via
the Scopus interface before exporting (in addition to selecting appropriate
columns/fields to export)).
